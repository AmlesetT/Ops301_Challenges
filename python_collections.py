# Author:                       Amleset Tesfamariam
# Date of latest revision:      09/06/2023
# Purpose:                      To create a script in Python that qualify certain conditions including: assigning a variable list to multiple string elements, printing elements from this list, and changing the values within this list.
# Reason:                       It is important to know how to create, edit, find, and add to lists of different variables.


# Declaration of variables

# Assigning a list of ten string elements
my_list = ["carrot", "potato", "celery", "tomato", "garlic", "pepper", "salt", "spices", "broth", "meat"]

# Print the fourth element of the list (index 3)
print("Fourth Element:", my_list[3])

# Print the sixth through tenth element of the list (indices 5 to 9)
print("Sixth through Tenth Elements:", my_list[5:10])

# Change the value of the seventh element to "onion"
my_list[6] = "onion"

# Print the updated list
print("Updated List:", my_list)


# End
