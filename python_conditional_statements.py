# Purpose:                      To create a script in Python with certain logical conditions, including equals, not equals, less than, less than or equal to, greater than, and greater than or equal to.
# Reason:                       It is imperative to understand how to use these functions in relation to coding in Python.


# Declaration of variables


# Define two variables a and b
a = 100
b = 1

# If statements using logical conditionals 
if a == b:
    print("a is equal to b")
elif a != b:
    print("a is not equal to b")
elif a < b:
    print("a is less than b")
elif a <= b:
    print("a is less than or equal to b")
elif a > b:
    print("a is greater than b")
elif a >= b:
    print("a is greater than or equal to b")
else:
    print("None of the conditionals are met")


# End
